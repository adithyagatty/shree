                  1-800-778-7879.&nbsp; The arbitration shall be conducted by a
                  single, neutral arbitrator.&nbsp; Any claims or disputes where
                  the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand
                  U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding
                  non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party
                  seeking relief.&nbsp; For claims or disputes where the total
                  amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US
                  $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined
                  by the Arbitration Rules.&nbsp; Any hearing will be held in a
                  location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside
                  outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree
                  otherwise.&nbsp; If you reside outside of the U.S., the
                  arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the
                  date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the
                  award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
                  of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp; If the arbitrator grants you
                  an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that
                  the Company made to you prior to the initiation of
                  arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award
                  or $2,500.00.&nbsp; Each party shall bear its own costs and
                  disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an
                  equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.

                    Arbitration.</strong
                  >
                  If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the
                  arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or
                  based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall
                  be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.&nbsp; The
                  arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the
                  parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Time Limits.</strong> If you or the Company pursues
                  arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or
                  demanded within the statute of limitations and within any
                  deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> If arbitration is
                  initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and
                  liabilities of you and the Company, and the dispute will not
                  be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any
                  other cases or parties.&nbsp; The arbitrator shall have the
                  authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any
                  claim.&nbsp; The arbitrator shall have the authority to award
                  monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or
                  relief available to an individual under applicable law, the
                  AAA Rules, and the Terms.&nbsp; The arbitrator shall issue a
                  written award and statement of decision describing the
                  essential findings and conclusions on which the award is
                  based.&nbsp; The arbitrator has the same authority to award
                  relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law
                  would have.&nbsp; The award of the arbitrator is final and
                  binding upon you and the Company.

                  <strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY
                  WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT
                  AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead
                  electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by
                  arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp;
                  Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more
                  efficient and less expensive than rules applicable in a court
                  and are subject to very limited review by a court.&nbsp; In
                  the event any litigation should arise between you and the
                  Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or
                  enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY
                  WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the
                  dispute be resolved by a judge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</strong> All
                  claims and disputes within the scope of this arbitration
                  agreement must be arbitrated or litigated on an individual
                  basis and not on a class basis, and claims of more than one
                  customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or
                  consolidated with those of any other customer or user.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Confidentiality.</strong> All aspects of the
                  arbitration proceeding shall be strictly confidential.&nbsp;
                  The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise
                  required by law.&nbsp; This paragraph shall not prevent a
                  party from submitting to a court of law any information
                  necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration
                  award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Severability.</strong> If any part or parts of this
                  Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or
                  unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such
                  specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and
                  shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall
                  continue in full force and effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Right to Waive.</strong> Any or all of the rights and
                  limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be
                  waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.&nbsp;
                  Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of
                  this Arbitration Agreement.

                <p>
                  <strong>Emergency Equitable Relief.</strong> Anyhow the
                  foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief
                  before a state or federal court in order to maintain the
                  status quo pending arbitration.&nbsp; A request for interim
                  measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or
                  obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
